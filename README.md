# piere_Test2_RomansRalfs_Mitins

## General info
This project is ABANDONED.
Mobile view was completely broken and i was not able to fix it without assistance, which i was not able to recieve.

Considered bad due to:
Overall don't try to split everything- even in the backend task, there are too many comments- it makes the code unreadable. 
Also noticed the same problems in the github repo- everything is being split up even if it is not needed.
Not being hosted.

Frontend test for an internship for piere (no vƒÅrda pieredze).
